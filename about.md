I am <b>Madhumithaa Srikanth</b>. I am a senior studying at St.Joseph's college of Engineering, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. I am a data science and machine learning enthusiast and I am currently in search for jobs in the field related to data analytics. I hope to specialize in Bayesian Machine learning / advanced Data Science.

## Research

My research is broadly based on the following visions. When I research on a topic, I think about reinforcing the following practices:

- To scrap open source data and publish results in an open source manner and hence reinforcing data diversity and community learning. Most of the data science projects I have done are either published in the form of papers or open source findings in order to help the community with my results.

- To help make the world a better place with <a href="https://www.ijitee.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i12/L34681081219.pdf">Internet of Things</a>. I have researched about automation and scope of imporvement of power efficiencies in street lights. I hope to do so for other important day-to-day power consuming appliances.
